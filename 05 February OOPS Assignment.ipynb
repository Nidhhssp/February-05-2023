    "    * Encapsulation\n",
    "    * Abstraction \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. \n",
    "* The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. \n",
    "* The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "    * It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "    * It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism simply means having many forms. \n",
    "    * For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). \n",
    "* It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. \n",
    "* To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",
    "* A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Abstraction \n",
    "\n",
    "* It hides the unnecessary code details from the user. \n",
    "* Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.\n",
    "* Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes.\n"
